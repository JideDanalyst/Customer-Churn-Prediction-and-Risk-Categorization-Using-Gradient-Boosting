<h1>-Customer Churn Prediction and Risk Categorization Using Gradient Boosting</h1>

<h1>-Analysis Description
<h2></h2>
This analysis aims to predict customer churn and categorize risk levels in an online retail environment. The dataset includes various customer attributes, such as age, annual income, total spend, years as a customer, and satisfaction score. Initial steps involved data exploration and addressing missing values. Polynomial features were generated to capture non-linear relationships, and a Gradient Boosting Classifier was chosen for its robustness. Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV optimized model accuracy.
The tuned model was evaluated with cross-validation, showing strong performance with an overall accuracy of 98%. Predicted churn probabilities categorized customers into high (probability > 75%), medium (50-75%), and low-risk (<50%) groups. Visualizations highlighted the distribution of customers across these categories, indicating areas for targeted retention efforts.
In summary, this analysis provides a comprehensive approach to predicting and categorizing customer churn risk, achieving high accuracy and offering actionable insights for improving customer retention.
